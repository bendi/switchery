## Description

Switchery is a simple component that helps you turn your default HTML checkbox inputs into beautiful iOS 7 style switches in just few simple steps. You can easily customize switches, so that they match your design perfectly.

## Css only fork

This fork uses css pseudoclass ```:checked``` in order to achieve the same functionality as original switchery, so for documentation and details please visit [Switchery](https://github.com/abpetkov/switchery)
